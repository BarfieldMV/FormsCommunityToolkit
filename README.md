## Nuget Packages

NuGet is a standard package manager for .NET applications that is built into Visual Studio. From your open solution choose the *Tools* menu, *NuGet Package Manager*, *Manage NuGet packages for solution...* to open the UI.  Enter one of the package names below to search for it online.

Once you search you should see a list similar to the one below (versions may be different, but names should be the same).

## Principles

 - Principle #1: The toolkit will be kept simple.
 - Principle #2: As soon as a comparable feature is available in the Windows SDK for Windows 10, it will be marked as deprecated.
 - Principle #3: All features will be supported for two Windows SDK for Windows 10 release cycles or until another principle supersedes it.
